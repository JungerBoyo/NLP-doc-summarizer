Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\nZealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\nlooking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on\nthe floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted\ncords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. But beginning to feel very cold now,\nhalf undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\nthe harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very\nlate, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,\nand then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself\nto the care of heaven. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\nclock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that\nharpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then;\n_do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”\n\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\nushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\nwith a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\nharpooneers to sleep abreast. This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\nthat the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the\nsame time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out a Saturday\nnight clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business\nas selling the heads of dead idolators? But be easy, be\neasy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived\nfrom the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand\nheads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and\nthat one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s “Do you pretend to say,\nlandlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\nthis town?”\n\n“That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t\nsell it here, the market’s overstocked.”\n\n“With what?” shouted I.\n\n“With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”\n\n“I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I, quite calmly, “you’d better\nstop spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.” “No,” he\nanswered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to\nrise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm.—But to-night he went out\na peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,\nunless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”\n\n“Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are\ntelling me?” But I\nsoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\nunder the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\nespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\nthe window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\nthe immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\nnight. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon\nwhich Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never\nmind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,\nor on the weather side of an ice-island. I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that\nif he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\nthe half of any decent man’s blanket. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old\ndecanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,\nlike another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\nbustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells\nthe sailors deliriums and death. On one side hung a very large\noil-painting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\nunequal cross-lights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\nstudy and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\nthe neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\npurpose.",
