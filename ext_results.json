If you marry\nexpecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every\nstep that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing\nroom, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an\nidiot!... That’s my advice: never marry\ntill you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of,\nand until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen\nher plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable\nmistake. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,\nwith a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on\nhis face, began to talk—as one who has long had something on his mind\nand suddenly determines to speak out.",
