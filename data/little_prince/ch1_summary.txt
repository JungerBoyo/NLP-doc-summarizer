At six, I saw a picture of a boa constrictor swallowing an animal and created a drawing inspired by it. When adults mistook it for a hat, I made a second drawing showing the boa's inside, but they dismissed my art, urging me to focus on academics. Disheartened, I abandoned painting and became a pilot, where geography proved useful. Over the years, I showed my first drawing to test if adults understood it, but they always called it a hat, confirming their lack of imagination. Resigned, I spoke to them only about mundane topics to fit in.
