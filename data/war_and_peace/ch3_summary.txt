Anna Pávlovna’s reception features three distinct groups: one around the abbé, another around the beautiful Hélène and Princess Bolkónskaya, and the last around Mortemart, who shares an anecdote about the Duc d’Enghien. Hélène dazzles with her beauty and grace, captivating everyone, while her brother Hippolyte amuses with his peculiar appearance and behavior. The vicomte’s tale of magnanimity and betrayal intrigues the attendees, particularly the women. Pierre, awkward and eager, engages the abbé in an intense discussion on the balance of power, which draws Anna’s disapproval. She intervenes to maintain decorum and redirects them into the larger circle, showcasing her control over the social atmosphere.
