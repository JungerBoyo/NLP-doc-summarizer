Pierre, unable to sleep on a summer night, decides to break his promise to Prince Andrew and visit Anatole Kurágin’s gathering. The house is filled with drunken guests and chaos, including a dangerous bet involving Dólokhov, who drinks a bottle of rum while sitting on a window ledge. Pierre is drawn into the excitement, and, fueled by alcohol, challenges the others to match Dólokhov’s feat. Despite warnings, Pierre prepares to drink the rum, but Anatole stops him and suggests they leave for another event. Pierre, still full of energy, grabs a bear and begins dancing with it.
