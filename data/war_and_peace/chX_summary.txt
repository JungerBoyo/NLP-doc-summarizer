Prince Vasíli fulfilled his promise to Princess Drubetskáya by securing her son Borís a position in the Semënov Guards. Meanwhile, Borís’s mother, Anna Mikháylovna, returned to Moscow and stayed with the Rostóvs, whose home was bustling with visitors for St. Natalia’s day. Among the guests, talk centered on Count Bezúkhov’s ill health and his son Pierre, who had become infamous for his wild behavior. Pierre, recently expelled from Petersburg, had been involved in a scandal with Anatole Kurágin and Dólokhov, including a bizarre incident with a bear and a policeman. The conversation also touched on Pierre’s potential inheritance, with speculation about whether he or Prince Vasíli would inherit the count’s wealth.
