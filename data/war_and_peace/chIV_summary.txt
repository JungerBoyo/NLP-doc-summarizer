Prince Andrew Bolkónski, weary of society and indifferent to his wife, enters Anna Pávlovna’s reception as discussions unfold among the elite. He reconnects warmly with Pierre, his close friend, while Prince Vasíli and his daughter Hélène prepare to leave. Princess Drubetskáya, an impoverished noblewoman, pleads with Vasíli to secure a military appointment for her son, Borís. Though initially reluctant, Vasíli agrees after being reminded of his debt to her father and recognizing her persistence. She further asks him to recommend Borís as an adjutant to General Kutúzov, but Vasíli, though polite, refuses to promise this additional favor. Her mission complete, Princess Drubetskáya resumes her composed demeanor and waits to depart.
