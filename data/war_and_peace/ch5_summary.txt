At Anna Pávlovna's reception, discussions revolve around Napoleon, his coronation, and the execution of the Duc d’Enghien. Opinions are divided, with the vicomte condemning Napoleon’s actions and Pierre, in his youthful idealism, defending them as necessary for the greater good. Pierre's remarks provoke disapproval but also highlight his sincerity and passion for revolutionary ideals. Prince Andrew intervenes to ease tensions, acknowledging Napoleon’s accomplishments while critiquing his moral lapses. Prince Hippolyte lightens the atmosphere with a disjointed and comical anecdote, which, though poorly told, successfully redirects the conversation. The evening concludes with trivial chatter, as the guests transition from heated debate to light-hearted socializing.
