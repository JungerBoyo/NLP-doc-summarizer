After Anna Pávlovna's reception concludes, Pierre clumsily departs, displaying his absent-minded but kind nature. In the hall, Anna privately advances her matchmaking plans involving Anatole, while Prince Hippolyte awkwardly interacts with Princess Bolkónskaya, amusing the onlookers. Prince Andrew and his wife leave with Pierre, who later joins Andrew in his study. Their conversation shifts to Pierre's indecision about a career and his views on war, which he deems unjust unless fought for freedom. Andrew dismisses Pierre's idealistic remarks, explaining that wars are rarely based on personal convictions and that he is joining the army to escape his dissatisfying life. Their exchange highlights Pierre's naivety and Andrew's pragmatic yet disillusioned perspective on duty and war.
